# Plant-Disease-Prediction-
Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

Overview

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using a deep learning approach. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed using VGG16 and a custom architecture to classify 38 different plant diseases with high accuracy. The system leverages OpenCV for real-time image prediction, aiding early disease detection in plants.
